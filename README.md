Re-implementation of 3 of the core algorithms for object tracking, namely Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE), Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) and Dual Correlation Filters using raw features (grayscale or RGB) and HOG features on the task of tracking from the point of view of a UAV using the UAV123 dataset.
